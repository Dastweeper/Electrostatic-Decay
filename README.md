Electrostatic-Decay
===================
Here is where we will be doing our game.
/COMMUNITY MESSAGE BOARD/
-------------------------
When you submit/commit a file to this repository...give it a unique name. Michael accidentally overrote Ryan's work I believe.

So, please, make sure you Rename the project folder before you commit it.

And Ryan, please resubmit your work.


We will do 30fps, as I think that should work for the really small scope that we're going for. -Steven

Maybe we should consider branching. Right now we have 5 versions of the project, each with their owner saying "no touchie." That's cool, but let's number them, or we can branch.
Branching is basically what we're doing anyways.
