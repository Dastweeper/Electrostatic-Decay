Electrostatic-Decay
===================
Here is where we will be doing our game.
/COMMUNITY MESSAGE BOARD/
-------------------------
ANNOUNCEMENT: Programmers (Nelson, Jon, Michael, Ryan) we should meet this Sunday to put together the elements we've been working on into a coherent and single level.


We will do 30fps, as I think that should work for the really small scope that we're going for. -Steven
