If you want to see the code for yourself, open the .gml files in notepad or (preferrably) notepad++

STEPS:

1. Put the .gml files into your Game Maker Project's "scripts" folder
2. Call the script like you would any method, include the appropriate parameters
3. Look at the first line of the .gml file for list of parameters (it will be a comment, but don't change it; game maker uses it)

GENERIC EXAMPLE:

//calling a script
scriptFunction(param1,param2);
