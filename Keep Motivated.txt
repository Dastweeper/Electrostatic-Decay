Hey guys got most of the collision detection working.
There are two types of platform objects (platform, boundary)
Platforms the player can jump through and land on them.
If you press down and jump on a platform you will fall through to the floor below you.
Boundaries are rectangles the player cannot pass through.
Also, the gamepad inputs for left, right and jump are now working.  Just plug in your controller and it should work.

Keep motivated we can do this.
for some inspiration here are some links to two awesome games made with game maker.
